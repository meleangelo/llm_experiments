# llm_experiments

This repo contains some experiments that I am doing with LLMs.

This includes chatbots and extracting data from unstructured sources. 

[chatbotAI](./chatbotAI/): this folder contains a python notebook where I create a simple chatbot. It uses speech recognition to listen to what you say and responds like an italian grandma called Gina. 

coverletters: this folder contain my attempt to create cover letters for job applications, like many website promise to do nowadays. It is a simple version that writes a cover letter in the style of Donald Trump.
